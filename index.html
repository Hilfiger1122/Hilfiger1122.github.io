    <h3> Cinema E-Booking System </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Developed a comprehensive E-Booking System to emulate a complex booking website for movies in a team of 5 </li>
        <li> As a group of 5, work fluidly to deliver a system with as few flaws (if any) as possible </li>
        <li> Created a multi-functional website that displays different pages depending on the user </li>
        <li> Customers are given functionalities such being able to view the currently listed movies and their prices and avaliable seats for the specfic time of a screening and also will be able to create an account for special promotions, admins will be able to edit the current screenings of movies and adjust prices, and are able to create promotions for certain movies and control accounts of malicious users.  </li>
    </ul>

<div class = "card">
    <img src = "images/chatroom.jpg">
    <h3> Chatroom </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Utilized C to create a funtioning chatroom and allows users to interact with each other and create private spaces for specific people. </li>
        <li> Emulates how early chatrooms felt and the foundations for future chatting apps with the use of forks and threads in order to create seperate processes. </li>
        <li> Support multiply clients at once adn utilize sockets to properly allow clients to connect to the hosting server </li>
        <li> Implemented and allowed special funtion outside of casual chatting such as: sending pictures, adding friends, sending a whisper (private chat) to another user in the same chat room, and allow accounts to be made </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class = "card">
    <img src = "images/UnixShell.jpg">
    <h3> UNIX Shell </h3>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Worked individually to implement a unix shell in C with many funtions that you would find in the real Unix Shell </li>
            <li> Utilized many system calls included in C (fork,pipe,socket,threads,etc) in order to closely emulate what a user would experience using the real deal </li>
            <li> Implemented funtions such as merging files, creating directories, creating perfect duplicates of files, search for specific files, and many other functions related to the management of a system and it's content </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
